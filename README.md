Interstellar
============

This is just a test app to give you an example of [Stellars](https://github.com/jonathanKingston/stellar) use that I wrote in less than 5 minutes.

Currently all this does is display a different message on a different page but it sorts you out with routing and the way forward with no lines of code involved.

To run this you will need to put [stellar](https://github.com/jonathanKingston/stellar) in your meteor package directory and add it.

For a more complex example check out the dev branch of Britto: [Britto Stellar version](https://github.com/jonathanKingston/britto/tree/stellar)
